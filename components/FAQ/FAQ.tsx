    question: "Do I need to wrap EGLD ?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>Yes, you need to wrap you EGLD before doing any swap on the JEX.</p>
        <p>
          This can be done on the JEX in the wallet (top right, where it
          displays your EGLD value) or, if you prefer, on the Maiar DEX.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Trading directly with EGLD, via automatic wrapping, will be
          implemented in the future.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Why do I have to wrap EGLD to trade ?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          Because wEGLD is an EDST (Elrond Digital Standard Token) and JEX is an
          ESDT trading platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          You cannot trade EGLD directly, it must be wrapped in wEGLD just like
          on Maiar DEX. Except it is automatic on Maiar DEX (1 transaction for
          wrapping and 1 for swapping).
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Trading directly with EGLD, via automatic wrapping, will be
          implemented in the future.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "When are you listing on the Maiar DEX ?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          This isn‚Äôt currently in the roadmap. The team is concentrating on
          launching all functionality of the JEX and working to the roadmap in
          the litepaper.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "I can't see my see my offer in Search Offers ?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          This is as per design. You can only see your offers in the ‚ÄúMy Offers‚Äù
          tab. Rest assured your offer is visible to all other users in the
          ‚ÄúSearch Offers‚Äù tab.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Why can't I see my $JEX (and other tokens) in the Maiar app ?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          Maiar app only displays a limited number of tokens at present (EGLD,
          MEX, USDC, BNB, ETH, BTC {`&`} RIDE). No other tokens can be viewed on
          the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can see your balance of these tokens in the JEX, in the MultiversX
          web wallet or on the MultiversX explorer.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      "My offer disappeared and I don't see a transaction on explorer with the tokens being transferred ?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          Please refresh the {'"'}My Offers{'"'} page to see if your offer is
          there. If not reconnect + refresh to see if your offer is there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Failing that you may visit the blockchain explorer to find the
          transaction and see if it has been filled.
        </p>

    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any slippage fees for buying/selling ?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          There{"'"}s a fixed fee for trades. This fee can be seen just above
          the submit button when creating a sell offer or by clicking the i when
          viewing an offer to buy.
